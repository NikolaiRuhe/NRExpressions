NRExpressions
=============

The NRExpressions library is a leightweight expressions parser and interpreter library.

It can serve as an integrated, easily extentable, yet not-so-fast expression
evaluation engine. The language is defined using standard lex/yacc files and can be
modified without digging deep into the implementation.
